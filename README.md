this is a live demo for this sample page https://watheqalshowaiter.github.io/sample_page2/

## notes
this work is a try to make sample image of website into code in HTML/CSS.
is it not responsive (yet).
icons are not the same because I have not seen same icons in font awsome and I am lazy for use specific icons.
I have used: HTML, CSS , font awsome icons. for the griding component I have use flexbox way.
